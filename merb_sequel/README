A plugin for the Merb framework that provides support for Sequel models.

* adapter. :sqlite is assumed by default.
* database, default is "hey_dude_configure_your_database". This should be
  either :memory: or file path for SQLite.
* db_type: default is nil. Use "mssql" to connect to MSSQL using ODBC.

= Generators

After you install the plugin, merb-gen can generate Sequel models for you:

merb-gen model --orm=sequel Article

same with resources

merb-gen resource --orm=sequel Article


Note that if you have specified that you use Sequel in init.rb or environment
specific init file (for instance, environments/development.rb)
via use_orm :sequel, you need no specify --orm option explicitly when
using merb-gen.
